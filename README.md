# Vote Decoder
A simple website to decode the QR code printed out at in-person voting to allow voters to verify the correct choices have been saved.

**_NOTE:_** Currently only Los Angeles County, CA is supported, but I would be happy to add more if the decode data is available.

### Included Libraries ###
This site makes use of and would not be possible without the excellent html5-qrcode library, which you can find here: https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/

### Data Sources ###
Los Angeles County: https://lavote.net/ballot-marking-device-code-list
